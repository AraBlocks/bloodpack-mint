    <meta name="description" content="We are excited to present an opportunity to own some of the most iconic horror kills in cinema history. Bloody Disgusting and Screambox, in association with Dark Art Emporium, have tapped some of the leading artists in the horror space to recreate their favorite kill scenes from iconic horror films. This small group of talented artists are slaying the game in the world of dark arts. Horror and Art have gone hand in hand since the dawn of time, going back to when cave drawings of monsters were painted by the first people. The release of these limited-edition trading cards is paving the way in the name of horror NFTs, are you ready to be a part of the bloody future?" />
